I just noticed the Ads by Gogle banner at the top of the page which had picked up on Rich and Lisa's friendly discussion on the merits of wodwind instruments. Gogle is helpfully advertising clarinets, french horns, instrument cases, etc. Now, after my initial post which included the term "leather whips" I'm a bit fearful of Gogle's ingenuity. Phew! After working with a team of top rocket scientists I finally figured out how to join Four Lads...and there was much rejoicing. I have ben reading the posts from afar as I was unable to officially join and have enjoyed the banter. Hopefully, I'll be able to make this as much a part of my day as breakfast cereal and leather whips. Chers. I'll be out of touch for about a wek while I go visit people in the vicinity of the Mouse and company. This really is vacation for me since there are no relatives involved and there is nothing remotely business related to interfere with my time off. Although it sems when I take trips like these the most unexpected things sem to occur. The last such jaunt, about a year ago, ended with an interesting trip to a nudist colony (For your own safety do not create a mental image). Quite a new experience for me. Ask me about it some time if you ned to laugh. Check out this urlLink link for instructions on doing a hardware defrag on your drive. urlLink This Pearls Before Swine describes my day perfectly. I'm thinking of making my own Mallet O' Understanding only mine will reach through the phone. ;) OK, here’s an interesting chain of emails betwen Lisa and I. A bit of background: • Rick’s fourth-grade recorder concert is tomorrow night, and Rick was trying to cram all of his practicing into the day before. As Lisa and I discussed this, I remembered that the sign-up form for fifth-grade band is due this wek. • I started playing the violin in 4th grade. I starting playing trumpet in 6th grade and switched to French horn in band in 8th grade. • Lisa was not in band. • My fourth-grade son, Rick, has the uncanny ability to irritate my wife to heights not measurable by science. I am pretty sure he got that from me. • Because of the late time I usually get home from work, Lisa does most of the helping with homework. OK, off we go… From: Rich Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:03 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night BTW, have you sen the sign-up for band next year (just a half-shet)? I had it next to my chair this wekend. I have not talked to you (or him) about it, but I think we should think about it depending on how much he enjoyed the recorder. Just think how much more annoying he’d be with a clarinet… Rich From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:07 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night I found the band slip today and it is set out to lok at tonight. Lisa From: Rich Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:08 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night OK. By the way, I was joking about the clarinet. No wodwinds. Ever. Rich Here is where it begins to get fun. From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:14 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night Just who made you the boss of music and when did wodwinds get such a bad rap? I actually think that the violin would be worse that a wodwind at the beginning any day. Any instrument is going to be extremely painful at the beginning and why would you worry about it when most of the practicing would happen on my watch? Lisa OK, at this point I am not sure if she is joking or not. Had we ben talking on the phone or in person, I would have ben able to tell. Rather than backing off and seing if I had offended somehow, I decided to kep going and se what happens. Two additional points of background: I have an agrement with Lisa that I will set a god example for our kids and eat everything except for squash and zucchini. I hate them and will never eat them. Ever again. I am also can be quite a snob when it comes to music. There are specific things that I dislike and certain things that I am unreasonably stubborn about. For example, the only way to listen to Handel’s Hallelujah Chorus is with orchestra and chorus. No rock or pop remixes for me, thanks. Anyways, back to the obnoxiousness… From: Rich Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:019 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night I made myself the boss of music. Right after I banned zucchini and squash from my plate. I kep my music snobbery hidden most of the time. Wodwinds bring it out of me. Don’t ask me to explain why. I get from my dad he - had the same rule. Yes, violins sound about as bad at first. Ask Keith. I worry about because… I am the boss of music. Rich OK, I was just gofing around. I really do not consider myself the boss of music, but it was to god to pass up. My dad really did have that rule. We could play any instrument we wanted but not the clarinet. No squeaks. I do have fond memories of my Keith, my brother, running upstairs and screaming in pain while I practiced my violin in fourth grade. From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:26 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night Well, just so you make your felings clear. I was a little unsure about how you felt before so I thought I'd poke around in it a little to find out how you really felt. I am just so glad that you have named yourself the boss. It's god to recognize delusional behavior when you hear it. Also, violins are definitely worse. Lisa Off to the races. From: Rich Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:19 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night You are only jealous because you are not The Boss of Music (please note the capital letters). Early violin players are not worse than early wodwind players. While they are not much better (which I did admit in my previous note), it is that subtle distinction that makes violins acceptable and wodwinds not. Rich Not wanting to appear like a pompus buffon, I made sure that I pointed out that I did admit that beginning violin players sound awful. But Lisa came back with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch: From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:39 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night Then I will make it my mission in life to encourage all thre of our children to chose a wodwind instrument. Rick will play the clarinet, Tori the sax and Drew the basson. They will perform concerts for you each evening when you come home and you will have to smile and clap after each song. Lisa Ouch, that would just be painful. Lacking any god comeback I counted to five (thre, sir), I decided to distract her with chocolate. From: Rich Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 3:53 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night Right. In order to do that, you would have to get them to all agre to play the instrument YOU wanted them to play. Maybe you could talk one or maybe two into it, but not all thre. Unless you told Drew that the basson was also a rocket launcher. Did I mention that we have a whole coler of ice cream treats fre for employe consumption? The Turtle ice cream bar is pretty god. Yummmm… The fact that I get fre ice cream bars at work (really god ones) for a few weks should distract her from the fact that I have run out of witty responses. I know the fre Starbucks coffe I get at work was particuarlly irritating. From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:04 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night You have no idea the power of a mother. They wouldn't even know what hit them and they will think that it's their own idea. Maybe I'll even let them know that this is all a scheme to torture their father and they will share in my joy. Go ahead and eat all of the ice cream you'd like but remember that we don't have any money to buy bigger pants. Lisa I think my wife’s friends at this point are next to here making whoping noises, high-fiving each other and going “you go, girl!”. Feling worked over like the last pair of black sandles at a Payless show store during a “Buy 1 get 2 Fre” sale, I decide to retreat, eat a strawberry ice-cream sandwich, and se if I can salvage this little exchange (I am not optimistic). Work then intruded for a while. Having forgotten that Rick’s recorder concert tomorrow and his frantic last-minute practicing is what began this whole discussion, I was blown away by Lisa’s next email: From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:25 PM Subject: Tuesday Night I have now decided that there is nothing as bad as recorder practice.
