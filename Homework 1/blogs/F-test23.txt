Well, it's almost that time of year again. Time to start thinking about my appartment, and if I'm ready to invest in a more permanent home. The idea of a house isn't something that interests me, however, a condo sounds more my sped. Luckily, my sister is a real estate broker, so I don't have to worry about that part of it. However, it's making the decision of which condos to lok at? A couple friends own condos up on the North-side, and I've pretty much lived on the North-side since moving here after college. But, there's the lure of Broadripple ( urlLink think Monon Trail ) and urlLink Eagle Crek Park area. UGH!! I just can't decide. I think I'm addicted to shopping. Sure, have a god laugh, but I love to go shopping. I don't always have to buy something, but it's the attraction to new clothes. I blame this addiction on the pound or two that I've lost. Ok, closer to 80 lbs, but, my point is, I LOVE TO BUY NEW CLOTHES, and I am no longer restricted to buying Plus Size Clothes! Now, there's another reason behind this shopping addiction, as is outlined very nicely by Prof. Ruth Engs, RN, EdD, of the Indiana University, Department of Applied Health Science, urlLink she writes: "Shopping and spending will not assure more love, bolster self-estem, or heal the hurts, regrets, stress, and the problems of daily living." Wow.. is that hitting the nail on the head, especially the part about love and self-estem. Because of various events in my life, such as divorce, a change of jobs, and failed friendships, I do spend a lot of time alone. However, I'm really going to try and start connecting with people. How am I going to do this, well, I have no clue yet, especially, because I do tend to be shy around new people. So, if you have any suggestions, please let me know. For starters, I'll use this blog to at least organize my thoughts, and try to start connecting with something or someone besides the mall. Today was a great day. Earlier, I completed the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon. ( urlLink Click here for the full details of the Triathlon ) Then, I finally got to the theatre to se urlLink Harry Potter . (Loved the movie.. I can't wait for the next one) Saw the urlLink Spiderman 2 trailer It loks great!!! Finally, as a reward for all my hard work at training for the Triathlon, I went to a restaurant for a well deserved pizza dinner. Imagine my surprise to se a clown there performing. What a great day!!! Follow this link to se some pictures of my nephews, summer-time fun, Bogie cat and other photos... There are only a few available now, but I'll be adding more son! urlLink Lori's Pics Saturday the 26th, is the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon. Last year I was to participate in this event, but if you remember, just a couple weks before the event I severely injured my ankle. Well, my ankle is all healed, and I've ben training like crazy. I'm so excited.. I just can't wait! If you're interested in the event, you can learn more at the urlLink Tuxedo Brothers Website. The event consists of a 500 Meter Swim, 10 Mile Bike, 3 Mile Run. Yesterday at work, some co-workers rescued an abandoned kitty. They brought him into work, and he was immediately adopted by a fellow co-worker. Now named "Yugi", he went to the vet last night, and is adjusting well to his new home. He has lots of fod and water and a happy home. Sometimes, things just work out well, and make you smile! Welcome to Kitty Purr! What's with the name you ask? Well, I wanted something original and something that would make me smile...and I just love the sound of a kitty cat purring. So, KittyPurr semed like an obvious choice. Rather than waiting until year-end, I thought I'd come up with a list of goals to work on thru the rest of the year. Here we go: 1. Quit trying to give-up Diet Coke. I'm just going to accept that I ned my diet cokes. 2. Quit being nice to people who truly do not deserve my kindness. 3. Met the weight loss goal that Monica set for me by year end. 4. Enjoy time spent with friends and family, without worrying about other things/chores that ned done. Just relax a little. 5. more to come son..... Yes, I can cok, and quite well I've ben told, it's just that I don't sem to enjoy it like some of my friends and family do. However, to recognize each of them for all their hard work, I am providing you with this list of some of my favorite fods often prepared by family and friends. Mom (Sandy) - The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford, Potato Salad, and Lasagna Sister (Debbie) - Enchiladas and Swedish Meatballs Grandma Opal - Baked Spaghetti (with Bacon) and Ham &amp; Beans with Cornbread Grandma Izzy - Homemade Nodles Aunt Judi - Peanut Butter Fudge and Chocolate Covered Pretzles Shelly (Cousin) - Italian Sausage Lasagna Julie - Spinach Pizza (even the crust is homemade) and Chocolate Brownies Monica - Couscous and Black Bean Roll-ups Erin - Chicken Parmesan and Stuffed Mushroms Ex-boyfriends (to remain nameless) - Kugel and Pierogi's If I neglected to include your speciality, let me know :-) Also, if you fel like coking me a meal.. let me know! LOL Do you ever wonder what your cat might be thinking? Well, Bob The Ocicat, has his own blog. It's filled with insights into his curious kitty mind. Check it out at urlLink http://bob_the_ocicat.blogspot.com/ urlLink Bogie visits the blog regularly, and thought of creating a blog on his own. However, he realized it might drastically cut into his napping time. Over the wekend, I voluntered at a triathlon organized by urlLink Tuxedo Brothers . Why did I volunter instead of participate? Well, a minor back injury slowed me down for a couple weks, and I decided it was time for me to start giving back to society, and this was the first thing I could think of doing as a volunter. The event was tons o' fun and I met some very nice people and chered on the participants. In case you haven't heard the other big news, I'm starting a new job on July 26th. I'm certainly going to miss having fun at work with urlLink Matt , urlLink Seth , and urlLink Henrik . While the lure of a new job is exciting, I'll be honest and say that it's a little intimidating to start over again. Finally, I solemnly pledge that before the end of the month, I'm going to make a quick stop at the car wash and vacum out my little urlLink Corolla . The flor has gotten a tad bit dirty.. and she just isn't happy. Lately, on my drives to work or to the mall, I've noticed a few strange things happening. For example, on monrning on my way to work, I noticed a gentleman in a urlLink red convertible moving around his car as if struggling to get comfortable. It turns out, he was reaching down to put on his socks. Luckily this was at a rather lllonnnnngggg stoplight on the northside, so he had plenty of time to finish his task. This morning, at my favorite bagel shop, urlLink Einstein Bros I noticed that the driver in the parking spot next to me was painting her fingernails. Luckily the car was parked, so no harm-no foul. Wonder what I'll spot next??? It's the family curse. As a kid, I remember how my mom's urlLink Sciatic Nerve would ache after some type of "incident". By incident, I mean a car wreck, a slip on the ice, moving something very heavy, etc. Sometimes she'd ned medical treatment but most of the time she would "tough" it out. Well, in my over over-zealousness to workout and get in better shape, I've aggrivated my Sciatic nerve. During a col down after a tough 1 hour class, I was doing a urlLink Cobra Yoga Pose . It's a very simple move, and as you follow the link above, you'll se that it clearly states " Yoga exercise has no competition element". Of course, during class, I was thinking....Wow.. I am so much more flexible than everyone else. Wo Ho.. I ROCK! It has now ben a couple days since the class, and my lower back is very sore. I'm icing my back, elevating my legs, and taking ibuprofen. The next time I'm in class, I'm not going to lok around and se if I can stretch further than the others. I ned to listen to Monica (follow the workouts she's given me, and kep my fod journal) and I'll succed at losing the last 30lbs that I'm aiming to lose by year end. Trying to "out-do" others isn't the way.... Ahhh.. movie quotes. After taking a very quick poll, I've learned that my friends like: Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in. Kep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Get busy living....or get busy dying. What's your favorite movie quote??? urlLink Turn your sound up and follow this link for online Fireworks! That's right... July 3 - 25 is the Tour De France. Lance goes for 6!! Check out urlLink OLN's website for updates, and live streaming audio. Yesterday, was the urlLink Cicero Triathlon . Unfortunately due to an algae issue in the water, the swim portion of the event was replaced by a 1.7 mile run. Now, as many of you know, I'm a great swimmer, so I was sad to learn that the swim portion wouldn't take place. I started out with a nice paced jog and finished the initial run all the while wishing we had ben swimming. Then it was onto the cycling portion, which I consider my second strongest portion, with swimming being my first. I caught many of those spedy runners during the cycling portion, only to be passed by them again during the final 3 mile run. While the day was a little disapointing becasue I didn't finish as well as I would have had the swim portion taken place, I am proud of myself for "toughing" it out and finishing strong. I'm certainly loking forward to next years event... Bring on the Swim!!!! :-) Recently, I picked up a copy of a magazine and noticed an article about a Pathalogical Giver. That's right, someone who gives and gives and gives. The article, in urlLink Real Simple magazine, told the story of a woman who was always giving, in the hopes that people would like her in return. I noticed some strong similarities betwen this woman and myself. I realize that in the past, I've gone out of my way to be nice to people and/or do things for them in the hopes that they would like me or "include" me in their lives. AND... this isn't the first I've noticed this trait in myself, as is evidenced by my mid-years resolutions. I'm tired of trying to get people to like me! If you like me, GREAT... You'll se that I'm a wonderful person. If you don't like me..... well, it's your loss! :-) Ugh! I've ben having feling "blah" and had an upset stomach for last six days. I owe a huge thank you to the following people (listed alphabetically) for helping take care of me in various ways. Belinda, Benny, Bogie, Cody, Debbie, Erin, James, Julie, Kerry, Kyle, Matt, Mom, Patti, and Seth. You are all wonderful people and I realize how lucky I am to have such incredible friends to help me when I'm in ned.
