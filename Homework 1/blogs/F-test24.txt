So its not as bad as i think. i go to get weighed in on tues....I really was expecting to weigh at least 4 lbs more. I mean i ate and drank like a champ this wekend. But when i stepped on the scale it said 204.8! so i lost .2 lbs. Thats nothing, but its better than gaining! ttyl I drank all wekend long...I partied my ass off...got wasted...ate pot brownies..then ate lots of fod. God why did i do this to myself? Se when I get wasted I screw up on my diet. Iam going to LA today...cross your fingers for me. I hope i didnt gain all teh weight back that i lost(the entire 4.5 lbs..) I will let you know.... Went to LA yesterday!! Down to 205!! lost 1.4 lbs. Its a start! GOOOOO MEEE! So i went back yesterday afternon. My weight was 206.4. So i dropped one pound! I guess it wasnt so bad since I drank lots of ber on friday night. Other than that I think I did pretty well on my diet this past wek. Its ben so hard making sure I eat all the fod I am supposed to in the day. This wekend is going to suck though. I have people coming in from out of town so all we are going to be doing is drinking and eating...Whats a fat girl to do??? So i spent another $212. dollars on those freakin bars yesterday. What a ripoff this place is becoming. So far it i have spent 540 +212 = 752 dollars. That could of ben my freakin Louis Vuitton Bag!! I am so pissed. But I swear if i lose this weight I WILL BUY MYSELF A FAB PRESENT. I WILL BUY MYSELF A VERY EXPENSIVE PURSE!! 160 POUNDS IS ONLY 50 POUNDS AWAY!! So i have to lose only 57 more pounds...UGH...i cant take it... Til next time.... Ok. so I think this may be easier to se my results by keping a diary of them. so here goes So i joined La weight loss on tuesday...Walked in wanted to lose 30 lbs. but in reality really ned to lose like 70 to be my "ideal" weight...what a crock. So anyway when i was in there i honestly thoguht the girls we on crack. So happy to se ms.fatty herself walk in. So basically they completely bring me down and tell me the only way i will ever be skinney is through them...so what does a fat girl to do? So i decide to join....oh no here goes.... So they do the membership and $600.00 dollars later i walk out with this juice and the idea that in only 15 weks i will be 30 lbs liter. Wish me luck... So anyway think two days later...I have eaten all the meats and gren leafy veggies that i can. Even when i shitz its plain gren...how gross. And that nasty drink..tastes like crap and smells even worse. But I do it and I go back to LA for my next consultation. This is where they weigh me and TADA! I have lost 1.7 lbs. Gez dont know how...but lets se thats a god start. So they sit me down and fed me more crap about their company and continue to put me on this pedastol...(i am trying to figure out what they are on...whatever it is...i want some). So they put me in this rom to watch a video on these lite bars that supposedly without them you wont lose the weight...but i thought in the commercial you could eat your own fods...DUH stupid me. Guess i should of known better. So then after the video they proced to tell me i can open up this credit card to pay for these bars...what a crock of shit. So I tell them no, and they proced to tell me they are gonna cost me over $900.00 BUT i am saving $500.00 by doing it this way. So now i am thinking god. i just spent $540 dollars to join and now they want another $1400 from me...OMG what an idiot i am. Who told me to sign up for these things? So I leave in not such a great mod...Kinda rude to the cracked out consultants that work there. Oh well. But i did lose 1.7 lbs! So i guess its a start. So here goes. My weight(which by the way I would NEVER tell anyone) started at 209.3. Now 207.4lbs. so i will type more after my next meting.... bye! Well here goes. What a bad wekend. I went to get weighed in on sat and i was 197.6. So i lost only .2 lbs once again. So of course i was super pissed. I decided to just eat and eat untill i burst i guess. I didnt eat what i wasnt supposed to, i just ate everything on my daily diet within 5 hours. I dont know why. Then the next day i ate pizza, and bread and all kinds of bad stuff. Then i came home really late and ate peanut butter and jelly sndwh, a shit load of veggies and chese and rice cakes. All within 15 minutes. I completely gorged myself sick. I then decided to drink this diet tea shitz. Well, i thought i was going to die with all the stomach pains i was havign this mornign. But i did cleanse my entire system out. I am sure there is none of that left. God i sat on the toliet for almost 1 hour with the worst freakin cramps EVER. I havent figured out why i do this to myself. WENT TO LA TODAY! LOST 2.4 LBS SINCE MONDAY! I am so freakin happy! i now weigh 197.8 lbs! I am finally weighing as much as Eric does! This in great! I am so happy! And only 18 more lbs til I hit my goal weight! Then after that I can continue this diet until I weigh 150 lbs. OMG if i can actully go to 180, then going to 150 wont be that much harder. I just have to stick it out until next summer. Make this a way of life for me. I know i have to stop drinking that diet tea though. I am sure that dieteritcs arent the best, but it helps cleasne me out! I will write more after my next visit. I cant believe i ate that much ice cream and didnt gain. I guess considering it was fat fre and then i puked out like 1/2 of it anyway. I guess no matter what i do, I will always have my eating disorder. I hope that by losing the weight the healthy way I can try to maintain it and not let it get out of control, the way it did before. Well its ben over 1 month since i joined LA and when i started i was 209.7. Now i am 197.8. Thats 11.9 lbs lost so far. I started June 16. That is 5 weks. so that is an average of 2.38 lbs per wek. since i have about 4 more weks til vacation that means i can lose another 9.52 lbs by then. I do want it to sped up though. I want to be skinny for my fam to se me. but 190 is nothing. But 185 would be nice...180 would be better. but i highly doubt i can lose 17.8 lbs in 3 weks. thats 6 lbs a wek! But we can try right? Well, Its offical. I finally lost some weight. I am now 200.2. So i lost some. Not much at all. So its like 9.5 lbs so far. Well nothing is new, cept i quit drinking for the time being. That should make quite a difference. The problem is that what am i supposed to do in my fre time now that i am not a lush? I will write more later Ok...if this isnt bad...i dont know what is. Going on my fourth wek of la. I now weight a TOTAL OF 202.2! I have ben back and forth at 202 for the past 2 weks. I know i am not at a standstill..i just cant stop eating!! Agh! so freakin aggreavating! I am going to follow the diet to a T. Starting today. No cheating. Nothing out of the diet. No snacking AND no late eating. Last meal at 7. Only a fruit after that. God..if I ever asked you for one thing. Let it be this. I know this sounds so stupid. But i would be a happier person if i was thinner. Everything for me would come together. My life...everything. I just want to lose this weight. I just want to be skinnier. Please give me the strength and the will power not to gourge myself everyday and follow this meal plan exactly! i ned to lose this or i will lose everything important to me. i have a really bad feling my man will leave me. What will i do with Jacob? Ok...this pretty much blows...so i went to la this morning. I was actually(this might sound dumb that a 200 lb person can say this) but i felt skinny todya...honestly thought this stupid cantalope express would work. BUT I WAS WRONG...i GAINED .2 LBS. so now I am up to 202.4. This sucks. i did definitely cheat on the diet though. I ate wingys last night...SOOOOO and i ate a peanut butter rice cake. SO i blew it. But i am starting over fresh today. I really, really hope that i can get below 200 by the end of the wek. That was my goal. But doesnt sem like it is giong to happen. If i could just kep my mouth wired shut then i wouldnt have this problem. Thats my biggest problem. I eat when i am not even hungry. I ned to figure out why and how to stop it. CAN ANYONE HELP???? I hate this...i mean...its coming off...but really freakin slow!! I am down to 202.2... I am doing this express take off thing right now...Basically its like starvign yourself..I better lose weight from this! i swear this is hard to do...i willlet you know how the express thing goes. I will type more on wednesday.! OK. SO I OVERGUESS MYSELF. I HONESTLY THINK I AM GIVING THIS FIGHT UP. I WENT TO GET WEIGHED IN TODAY. I AM DOWN TO 195.8. SO I HAVE LOST 14 LBS EXACTLY. TAKES SOOO LONG. I MEAN I AM HAPPY THAT I AM NOT OVER 200 ANYMORE, BUT ITS TAKING SO FREAKING LONG TO GET OFF. THEY UPED MY FOOD BY 1/2 PROTEIN AND ONE STARCH. THEY SAID IT WOULD HELP ME LOSE THE WEIGHT FASTER. THEY SAID I WORK OUT TOO MUCH FOR THE DIET I AM ON. I NEED TO EAT MORE SO MY BODY BURNS THE FAT. I AM SO IRRATED WITH THIS SLOW WEIGHT LOSS. LAST TUESDAY I WENT IN AND I ACTUALLY GAINED A POUND. HOW CRAZY IS THAT. I JUST CANT WAIT UNTIL I AM 180. THAT WAY I KNOW THAT 160 IS CLOSE BY. NOW THAT IS ONLY 16 LBS AWAY BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT COME OFF FASTER. I AM NOT CHEATING. I AM NOT EATING THE WRONG THINGS. I AM WORKING OUT LIKE A MANIAC AT THE GYM. DONT KNOW WHY ITS JUST NOT WORKING! ANY SUGGESTIONS???? PS I STILL REMEMBER THINKING I AM SO FAT. I WEIGH 181. I CANT CONTROL MYSELF. NOW LISTEN TO ME I WEIGH 15 LBS MORE THAN THAT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY AT 181. OK. so my trip to la last wek. I was pretty bummed out. When i got on the scale i had gone back up to 197.8. So the lady sat me down and told me i have ben going to that location for 5 weks. I had only lost 7 lbs in those 5 weks. Iwas 3 lbs behind schedule. I honestly dotn know what i have ben doing wrong. All i do is measure, weigh and work out. WHat a pain. But then i went on sat, and i was down to 196.4. So I should be at 194 by now...This really sucks my ass. I have to lose 17 more lbs by my birthday. Only less than 2 months away. So far i have lost 13.3 lbs. I dont know what to do. I defintiely cant be the fat ass walking into this wedding. Everyone saw my skinny pictures and knows at one point i only weighed 160 lbs. I swear thats 37 lbs away. But if i could lose the next 17 for the wedding. Then it would be fab. Kep u updated
