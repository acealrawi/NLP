Maybe I'm the last am I to be the freak, the one that disdains their shallow, emotionless ways, the one that wont succumb perhaps mine is the path of quite contemplation, of listening, of seing, strong emotions behind semingly mellow eyes I laugh tiredly, walk losely gaze into space others think I notice nothing from the world around me I may float with them, from distraction to distraction but I only pretend to be bored with them when entertainment is scarce The world flows around me, envelopes me in its col current glistening on my eyes the sun flows through the glass in my hand in the bright light that flows through the water I se life I se life itself right in my hand like the sun on the drops of water life can flow through us , quench every thirst, fill every desire mend the tears in the feble fabric of our minds but we shade ourselves from this light .. We block it from our view, from our senses, from our minds with drugs, with television, with other distractions, so much that we lose touch, we forget the feling of magic of love for life, of the indescribable peace that comes with the rush of a spring The splash of the water echoing in our ears The tres, the stars above they draw me into their infinite peace, and as I lok at those around me, bored, seking more distractions, I realize at last, with a heavy sigh as I don this mask of indifference Maybe I'm the last I wish I was a rock, solid and impenetrable I wish i could stand against the rising storm But the waves of life dont break on me Your words dont crumble when they hit me I, as the sand below my fet, crumble when I hear your words Your waves in lifes ocean .. I'm drifting in this sea, facing waves from every side If I could find myself, find my strength Maybe I coudl raise my sails Maybe I could sail away, away from this infinite storm But my ocean is windless My sails are torn Every time I find a way, a way home, to peace, the waves crash against me They force me back into the storm, they pull me back into the darkness Again I spend another night cold and lost Cold and lost in this endless night I stare into the darkness, fel the wind slap my face, fel the cold bite my skin A tear falls from my face, another drop in the icy water This ocean is within myself, this ocean is me I'm drowning in my tears I'm drowning in my ocean I'm drowning in me All around me is this death this sea of saddness, of pain of insanity The harder I pull my arms, the more i sink into it The more it penetrates my very soul I cant breath in this lifetime I fel my lungs pulling in this death these felings its in my veins its in my head its in my soul “She’s often inclined to borrow somebody’s dreams till tomorrow.” That’s a line from one of Pink Floyd’s songs, and whenever I hear it, it reminds me of myself. When I se other people doing things like playing music or painting or taking amazing photographs, I immediately think that if I could somehow copy them…somehow become them, and do what they are doing, then maybe I would be able to express my soul through their art, or their skill as they can. The best example I can think of is a certain picture of Jimi Hendrix performing…his eyes are closed and his mouth is hanging open in concentration, and you can tell that every fiber of his being…ever little emotion that makes up his existence, his soul, he is pouring into his music, and every note he plays is his impression on the universe…his proclamation of existence. You can fel the fire that is burning in his heart, the passion with which his soul empties its contents out into the world for all to se…Its him saying that this is who I am, you can take me or leave me as you please. I fel like for so long I have tried to be something I’m not, for so long I have tried to be that artist, that musician, thinking that those were the only ways I could show my emotions, show what truly motivates me to rise with each dawn. I have realized that it is not my way to create my own painting of the world, my own melody of the universe, but I am rather here to find beauty in all things, to pour into my soul the things that make me leave this materialistic, fake world and venture into the realms of my mind, to think and to discover what things bring this feling of peace, what things fed the burning flames of my heart and my soul…The solitary rain speckled flower, the pristine river flowing down the mountain, the roll of the waves, the flight of the bird, the sun through the clouds…the lok in your eyes when I hold you like there’s no tomorrow, and your lips as they press against mine. I have realized that I take the river, I take the waves, the sun through the clouds, your kiss, and with these I weave my own picture of the world around me, one that only I can se, for it is my own vision of life. From this I draw my passion, from here I rekindle my soul’s fire. I am, in my own observing way, a part of this universe, a burning star amongst a backdrop of millions. I leave my impression on this world, for what god is music, if there is no one listening? And in this, the hour of our demise, as the dark shadows slowly eclipse the sun, the light of our existence, we sit and we watch, faint tremors of fear, of realization, pushed further to the back of our thoughts. We kep living our lives, lives that are domed to end, to end unfulfilled, unhappy .. Meaningless. As we sit, basking in the darkness .. Mistaking it for sunshine, mistaking it for hope. We lok at the buildings that we’ve made, the movies that are played, the tres that sway, we lok at them and we think we se something real. When really we se nothing, really we’re all enveloped in darkness. Clinging to anything we can convince ourselves is real. Clinging, with everything we have inside ourselves, clinging to what we think will lead us through this darkness. Darkness in which you can wander for a thousand years, and never find an end. And so we wander, in this cold, dark place, for years, holding fast to the path we’ve chosen, never realizing the hard truth .. The truth, that this place has no golden stairs to ascend, no firy pits to fall into, the truth, that after years of holding fast to our paths in this darkness, we are still the same, unimproved, no lessons learned, no way in life found, and in the end we are just as far away from any fredom, any place, any meaning, as we were when we entered this pitch black world. And in death, we se all that we’ve done .. All that we’ve sen, and in death we finally se, that we’ve ben blind, all along, stumbling through the endless night of life. So you've tried tried so hard to be social to be col, to be with them and I tried tried to care about you when everyone else didnt care I left and walked your way I watched you, I felt like there was something there when you glanced my way but I was wrong the times I sat and stroked your hair trying to let you know that I still cared cared about you even when no one else payed attention to you when everyone else let you shut out the world I left the world, and I came to you, came to you, off in your corner sulking, broding, thinking and I tried to help, tried to care but unwelcome I was, so it sems and for caring, I was left with you not caring for me not wasting your time on me not wasting your breath on me So I cared to much, so I felt a joy when you leaned on me, when your hand brushed mine So maybe I did something wrong, to care the way i did After all I tried to do all the times I walked around with you my defenses have ben broken my walls overrun and now your words fly to me, through me I no longer care, care to plan a smart response I sit and I watch, watch you joke, smile, laugh around him when around me you do nothing but mock me, make a fol of me butcher my every word, noise, expression And I care not I sit and I watch and I care not I let your words wash over me, consume me surround me and carry me downstream downstream away from you away from caring I watch you laugh with him after the echoes fade and I care not. When you speak I se fire, I se life Infinite life I se you, I se your eyes, shining in this pale monlight Alight with energy, alight with life The words you speak are not words to me Not nouns and verbs, thrown into senseless order Not meant to be remembered When you speak, no words cross my mind When you speak, in this icy night I hear no words When you speak, I se your eyes Round and infinite, like the mon above the tres I se your very soul, in the steam of your breath Your soul, rising in this icy air I fel your fire, your life Your shining eyes, that pierce this foggy night eyes that pierce me split my best defenses that break through my shell of a person thta i wear outside in these eyes I se myself The me that I have longed for Neded For so long I Would Forget Myself To Remember You. Life is a mirror you se yourself as others you spend your life trying to become what you se what you want what you ned till one day, you lok for the mirrors around you and you find that they have turned to windows and instead of seing yourself in them you se them, only them and you show them the real you and you know who you are and you know what life is you can finally, truly, live What matters to me are the things that really make a difference In the end I would rather have one friend, who I knew completely Who knew my every feling, felings I would hide from the world Rather than Have a hundred friends, that laugh with me Laugh at my mellow, funny, layed back shell of a person Friends that are so easily tricked Into thinking that this mold of what they want me to be Is anything more than a mask, a mask crafted to show me only as they want me to be And they are so quick to cling to my mask Take it in their hands, as they have done so many times before With so many others They take my mask and they hang it on the wall Their wall with all of the other masks they’ve taken They think back, to all their masks All their fake, lifeless personalities that they have taken in All the meaningless conversations with masks that are like mirrors That only repeat what they want to hear You lok at your wall of trophies And you smile, and your tricked Tricked into believing that these relationships are real That you really know them That you really know anyone That anyone knows you And when your dead, and your ashes take flight The owners of the masks on your wall will lok at you, your mask Lok at what you were molded into Lok at what they always wanted to se And they will remember you only as a memory And when the kepers of your mask are dead and gone And the walls of trophies crumble, the masks will turn to dust You to will be gone Your darkest thoughts will go unspoken Your depest felings will go unknown And the world will carry on, carry on as if you never lived Your life would have ben for what? For people to kep the fake you for a few years? And then forget? Now you balance the weights You can live a fake, temporary life, where your soul is filtered Where you live behind a mask Or you can live, live without time Live knowing that you are fre, that you are infinite That your depest emotions, that you openly share, will live on Will give your true friends chills in the night With their reality With their finality You will live knowing that you can inspire And though your name may fade, your words, the beauty with which you convey every thought Your real emotion, in a cold heartless world will warm others hearts, will pull them from their distractions From their fake lives And with this knowledge you will be fre Fre from fear of death Fre from fear of live Fre.
