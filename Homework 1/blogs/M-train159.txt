urlLink Well, I'm back. Instead of the picturesque scene you saw represented below, reality loked more like what you se above. the weather varied betwen sprinkling, raining, and snowing (just those thre), and the trail had't ben maintained in a while. lots of underbrush grown over the trail, logs to climb over or under, and snow drifts to hide the trail all added up to one soaked christopher by the time I set up my tent (at that point wherever I could find a flat spot big enough). Chock one up to experience. there were were two nuggets of wisdom validated on this trip: Always take a change of clothes to leave in the car for the ride home; and, alway take a roll of (emergency) plastic tape. The reason for the first one is obvious, the second one was validated this morning when I woke up to six inches of fresh snow that obscured my path the night before. I would have ben bummed if I hadn't marked my trail. The Lord is god, and there will be other wedends for adventure (like next wekend). urlLink Check this out! somebody with far to much time on their hands constructed a map of springfield (not oregon) by watching episodes of the simpsons and noting geographical markers. Ever wondered what strets Homer uses to get to work? Neither have I, but now you can know anyway! urlLink Guide to Springfield USA urlLink Well, maybe this picture will give you a better idea of the sort of place I am going. Maybe. urlLink urlLink I will be here for the wekend: Jefferson Park. I promise to bring back lots of pictures. (Hopefully the threat of rain will drive away any crowds) (also, hopefully but less likely it will not rain) urlLink This is great! Thus, my first deposit: I think questions are god. (Hey! What do you expect for two cents?) There is a new feature on my urlLink website . (Drumroll please....) Question of the wek! Every wek I indend to have a new question open for discussion on an adjacent urlLink blog . Give us your 2c. urlLink and one of my neice, Riley Rose urlLink urlLink recent picture of my little bro. pretty menacing, huh? urlLink Okay, so I'm new to this whole thing... but what a better place to stretch my wings than Chris' blog. :) Here it is! the website, as you already know is off the ground (even if not fully constructed), and this blog will serve as the forum. If you want to participate in this forum email me and I will send along an invitation. Also, for those of you with newsreaders (go here if you don't have one but want one: http://www.rssreader.com/) this is my rss fed for this blog: http://christopherlayton.blogspot.com/atom.xml urlLink Gifford Pinchot National Forest - Campground Information Hey Chris, This is your test to se if the button on my gogle tolbar works. And, oh lok -- fires are allowed at the Forlorn Lakes! Yippe! Well, I've ben a part of this blog for a couple weks, I though I'd better quip in quick with my 1.5c. (Sorry, I'm Ã¼ber-por...) Titanic in 30 seconds, re-enacted by bunnies. yes, you heard (or, in this case, read) that correctly. urlLink Titanic in 30 seconds with bunnies. : "Titanic in 30 seconds, re-enacted by bunnies." urlLink This just in: Linus is moving to portland next wek. Why, you ask, should you care? I don't really know. (se the preceding post)Linus is the ubergek, Se urlLink slashdot article; urlLink Okay, I laughed out loud - and (whew!) didn't score to highly (24.45759% - Gek) on the Gek test - how did you score? let me know. urlLink The Gek Test Hey, lokie here, a new question for a new wek. urlLink Question of the Wek [experiencing technical difficulties] Or, at least I was. If you've wondered why posts have ben lacking lately, it is because I finally chucked my Microsoft CD's out the window. I am operating on a "brand new" computer: the same hardware now running urlLink Fedora Core 2 (formerly Red Hat Linux) I don't have everything up and running yet (DVD video, TV tuner, some other things aren't configured yet) but I was pleasently suprised just how much worked "out of the box" (iPod, SATA RAID, dual head monitor/dual video cards, etc). It is loking god and running notably faster than under XP. Anyhow, I am up and running again. Some fod for thought... urlLink Chicago Declaration of Tim recently pointed out an article to me on social/political issues in the evangelical Church. I found it thought-provoking and wanted to share. God fod for thought.... urlLink Main Article urlLink Reader Responses It lok as if the Sailhamer course at Western this summer will be held July 12-16 10am-5pm. The class will be about the bok of urlLink Genesis Have you any vacation time to spare?! (having taken several classes from the God Doctor, I say it is worth it.) According to urlLink JK Rowling's website , the Half-blod Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort. We know that Harry is a pure-blod, but if it's not Voldemort, then who? My money's on Hagrid, who is two half-blods; giant and wizard. I know it sounds weird, but it sounds weird enough to make sense in Rowling's world. Or it may be a new character... And, oh man, did I just tip my hand as a gek... Though I only scored 26.4% on the test... Ah, yes; Let the madness officially begin: the Title of the sixth Harry Potter bok was released today by J.K. Rowling, though no word yet as to when to expect publication. I, personally was a late-comer to the Harry Potter madness; but I did read the fifth bok (Order of Phoenix) in one sitting on the day it was released, so I guess you could say I have caught the bug. Oh, by the way the title is "Harry Potter and the Half Blod Prince" Any speculation on who this "Half Blod Prince" is? urlLink The Next Harry Potter Bok this has surfaced in my life several times; it surfaced again. For our mutual edification: MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not se the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may sem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. - Thomas Merton For those who must have a bibliographical reference, here it is: Merton, Thomas.

"For our sake he made hime to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." (v21) Ever wonder what the masses are thinking about? How about the Blogging masses. Now you can know, thanks to urlLink blogdex . This site is like a gogle news for weblogs. Blogdex's webcrawler pays attention to what sites weblogs are being linked to, and then posts the most popular sites. This is a pretty accurate way of "polling" what people are reading/paying attention to, since most blogs (like this one) use links to provide context for their comments. Blogdex also has a urlLink rss fed . Today the near miraculous happened, I enrolled for classes this fall at PSU. Praise be to God (and, by the way Lord, I'm not sure how this is getting payed for yet...). So, you might ask (actually, you didn't so I asked for you) what am I taking? PHL324 Intro to Formal Logic ENG490U Rhetoric ENG308U Top: Literature and the Enviroment ENG340U Medieval Literature BTW I have declared "Liberal Studies" as my major, which is a short-hand way of saying that I get to take pretty much what I want to take. And there was much rejoicing. okay guys, this is crazy - so crazy in fact that I thought it was a hoax until I started seing the photographic prof that these people are actually giving away iPods. So I signed up. If you want a fre one you should sign up to. But first read urlLink this and make sure to sign up using me as a urlLink referral urlLink freiPods.com Okay if that wasn't enough you can use the same company to get yerself a fre 27" Sony WEGA flatscren TV urlLink FreFlatScrens again use my urlLink referral code The Hitch: 1: You have to sign up for a fre offer (you know how those work - sign up and cancel before they start charging you AND 2: You have to refer so many people (5-8) who each have to sign up for an offer. Is this a pain? Yea kinda, but if it means getting a fre iPod or TV out of the deal I can live with it. urlLink Talked to my Brother last night: " Is that thermometer maxed out ?"
