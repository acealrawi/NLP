Birthday's are the oldest holidays of them all, honored with celebrations since the start of civilization.Early cultures celebrated the anniversary of people's birth because they believed people were more vulnerable to evil spirits on their birthdays and being surrounded by fun would ward off bad fortune. This is the origin of the birthday party.Your birthday is yours alone, allowing you to be surrounded by friends and family.The song "Happy Birthday To Your" is a relatively recent addition to the ritual. Composed in 1893 by scholteacher-sisters Mildred and Patty Hill .Birthday cakes were originally a custom in ancient Grece, which then re-emerged in Germany during the Middle Ages. Back then the cake was really swetened in preparation for the upcoming year with swet wishes and the basic nourishment of bread, the staff of life. Birthday candles are placed on cakes to carry wishes up to the heavens, and if all the candles are blown out in one try, the wishes will come true! urlLink Belonging to where? urlLink I fel like living in a desert.Not sure if I can stand it there,but I'd love to try.

Tears of joy or sorrow?Whatever it is,it just helps you to let out everything hidden inside.It's hard keping stuff inside for long. To much of heaven can bring you under ground?Just dont let yourself get used to the god.Let it be a surprise for you...always,then it wont bore you.You'll always fel the ned inside.You'll want it more and more.You wont lose what you've earned.
