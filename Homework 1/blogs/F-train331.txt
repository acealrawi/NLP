Yes that's right! You all hear me! The website is almost completely up and ready for viewing, I actually managed to get the template to work, along with other files... I still ned to add the comic as well. I won't give the link yet, but just you wait guys! Ta-ta! Ack not literally, I mean giving birth to a website! >_ I already have it up and running, but I still ned to make the template and whatnot. Kinda hard. It tok me 2 hours just trying to figure out how I can add some codes to my website, and what the heck an FTP is. I'm still a tad stumped actually, sorta ned help. A friend offered help, but in order to edit the website you ned the FTP program. Isn't that a boger? Didn't want him to download it neither, to much of a hastle. ^ ^; Anyway! The forums are up... actually they've ben up... should I give the link to my fellow readers? Or should I tempt you all... hmm. I'll go with tempting you. It's loking pretty god, I'm a first timer to so don't bite me once you se everything! GAH! I finally got it! Wow I'm so happy! Only... it doesn't really work. -_- It may take 2 to 5 days before your account becomes visible via ftp or http. Until then you may not be able to reach your comic's sitename, and your password and account may not work properly. Se that?... Uhhh. Evil account. Atleast I got it! After like a wek. Though now I'll have to wait longer than that for it to actually work. Damnut! This is what I get after trying to login: If you se this message, it means you have entered an incorrect password, but the form is working Curses! Oh well, I'll have to scan my comic later anyway. ^_^ urlLink http://www.xanga.com/AdiOpERsOcoM The music there is making me fel so god... and at the same time kind of sad. Especially with the recent post there. Anyway, the scanner works, but I have yet to scan the comic, and then color it. You guys might have to wait a while longer... I get the website tomorrow *throws arms up in the air*, but I still have to create it's template/layout. You can all wait right? Who is all anyway? What if no one even read this? O_o Haha funny thought. Leave comments if you want, I enabled guest comments. And it does. I tried joining, and it said that my I.P. address was banned... I never even joined the place before! It said that maybe there is someone else with the same I.P. as mine... but how is that possible? I ned help guys. ._. I was loking forward to joining to, to submit my creations and all there. Oh well. Going to dance practice for the first time since June, what a gleful day. I've missed practice, and today we all return and learn new dances. Yayness. :D Gotta go and se what I can do about Devian Art... Peace!! Curses of a million curses!!!!!!!!! No damnut! I just had to delete a cute little picture I drew in the oekaki board. It was a picture of Jan holding a refreshing drink. Like soda. That stinks!! I drew her so well to, one of my best oekaki creations ever. Curses! Gah!! *ahem* Sorry for that, I had to stress about it, people are like that sometimes no? Oh well, I'll just have to make her better next time. That's right! Much, much better. As for the comic, I have news for all of you simple and nonsensical little characters out there: My scanner is busted. But it's okay! I don't get my website 'till 4 days hopefully. Thus! Meaning my comic's debut! Simple Nonsense ! *audience applauds* You can all se I'm very excited, I really can't wait, I've ben working on it for days, brainstorming ideas and story lines. It should be awesome. Truly! So my loves, I have to go to my friend's house, must get ready! Fudgers. I can't post a picture here. Atleast I think not. But go here anyway: urlLink http://chugworth.com/ 'Tis a very god comic inded. It has inspired me. I lok forward to seing new ones!! This dude's got a talent hmm? Now I really have to use my own original characters to make a comic! The name of the comic shall be Simple Nonsense , it's self explainatory. Basically, you imagine simple nonsense am I right? It's nonsense, that's it. That's all you have to imagine. I have yet to actually make a story... I don't think I will, the whole comic is better off with Jan , Remy , and Mace [possibly I'll add another character later] and their misadventures in life. I'm excited, I can't wait until I launch it... my scanner isn't really working though... and photoshop is 'uninstalled'. Crudders. I think my brother uninstalled it. Talk about perfect timing. Lok forward to it guys!! I just registered for a webcomic site at kenspot but I haven't received the e-mail verification yet! Grr, hurry you darn e-mail!!!
