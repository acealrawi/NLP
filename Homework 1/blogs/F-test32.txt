Ding dong, the kids have gone, and after the drama of our gas leak yesterday, Cat and I are now safely back in our roms. And the campus is quiet - Kathryn, Louise and I will just have to work for thre or four hours and then our wekend kicks off. Should be an OK one, but really I am all about getting my rom started on being sorted and reading to pack up before heading home. Yes. Tonight was pretty nice - Daphne, Cat and I went to se Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , finally. It was really god, I thoroughly enjoyed iy , but I am kind of nervous to estimate what they may do to my favourite of the boks, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire !! Then we all went for pizza, and I had nice phone chats with Natalie and Val. Val is almost recovered from the trauma of last term, and Natalie and I are meting for dinner and drinks on Saturday. Am glad I've had a few ops to se her whilst I've ben down in Londonshire. Right, am going to go watch an ep of Sex and the City now! Current music: the Sex and the City theme tune Current mod: fine Last person spoke to: the ever lovely Cat, whilst she waxed her legs (oh, the joys of living together!! :-)) Next: Sex and the City , closely followed by no sex in bed. Seriously, how long has it ben? About two years you say? Dayum.... Why do I always fel so tired at the moment? What can I say, motivation is running a little low. This may or may not be down to my job, which at the moment is taxing and boring, always a dangerous combination. Nevermind, long wekend coming up. And then it's the final wek of working here before heading op north. Fab. Called Storrsie today. She sounds a little down at the mo, but I can totally empathise. As fab as it is to go home and all, I hate that feling on the first night back, after the manic catch up chats, when you are lying there in your jammies, staring at the ceiling, and thinking - what the fuck do I do now? I mean, it always turns out well, but I hate that first night back feling. Still haven't heard from festival. Not for the first time, procrastination may have fudged up things. Cat had to move out into one of the other boarding houses tonight (I'm already having to), because our gas sprang a leak. Drama, anyone? Current Music: RHCP: Higher Ground Current mod: sustained averageness Last person spoke to: MOSOD for Millfield Next: what do you think? Table dancing and Cristal? Tobey and Jake? Or teth and bed?

May all your dreams be peaceful and blissful tonight. It really is extremely cold for July. I'm originally from depest darkest Scotland, so you know when I put on a sweater, I ain't playing. But it fels practically autumnal. After a beautiful May and an iffy June, July is shaping up to be pretty por. So I am sat here, typing, loking out of the window. It's not even my window - no, tonight (and yesterday and tomorrow) I have to give up my cozy little rom and stay in one of the other houses. Odd, especially as I'd just gotten used to the last rom! It's really dark out there. Inside the house I can hear the creaks as the house settles, adults brushing their teth and phoning loved ones to say godnight, kids sleping heavily in strange beds. But outside is noiseless, still, erie. From here I can se the music block, it's lone security lamp a bright beacon against the dep dark around the rest of the view. We are usually spoilt with lighter skies in the summer, but tonight (at just gone 11), the sky is midnight blue, with a dep pink haze in the west as the final few warm bits of sunlight flicker and fade away. Whenever I lok out of a window, I always think of who else might be doing so, and once I've numbered my family and friends, I always wind up pondering the same people - the men in my life, past and present. Yep, the same people I think of when it's rainy, or last thing at night, or when I've had a little to much wine. Who else is under that shy? Is Tim loking up there now? If he is, I bet he's not thinking of me. I can't believe I fouled it up so comprehensively with him. I really liked him and I guess he liked me (well, so much that he came out and said so), but then it all hit the fan. I just hope he knows I care about him, and I hope we can salvage what was essentially a god friendship, before "relationship" stuff got in the way. Al's out there somewhere to - ah, the one that never was. Such a god friend, but I think he's destined to be forever and always, the man that got away. There were a couple of moments where I thought - maybe - dancing together, walking arm in arm, discussing jokingly our marriage in our thirties. Folishness, I know, but sometimes in the we small hours it's those warm and fuzzies that I depend on to kep me warm. There are others to - men I've cared about, men I've hurt, men I've used, men who've made me cry, men who've kissed me till my lips tingled, men who have given me a glimpse of who I might really be - and men who have done all of the above. Who's next on the list? I am tired of kissing frogs! The last person I had as a proper boyfriend was back in high schol, and I don't even have anyone to crush on (except the aforementioned Tim and Al, bith of whom I would hazard are now firmly part of "the friend zone"). I want someone to call my own, not another to just kiss and dismiss. I always get rid of them - will I ever learn to trust? I hope so. Current music: "Let Your Love Flow" on my 1st mix from JW. Nice. Current mod: reminiscent, longing, dreamy. Last person spoke to: Daphne (loking for a mosue), Cat (reclaiming the laptop and saying god night) Kathryn and Louise (signing off). Next: into PJs, brushing teth, grabbing teddy bear and swet, swet slep. Can't stand that day. Quite. Well I should really be at lunch, but I figured I'd get this post sorted first. The schol is absolutely crawling with posh kids, and of course a committe of vahry posh adults to (who kep on pestering me with requests for extra pillows, sliced rather than diced ham, and a million and one other things that would never occur to a less eccentric soul). She works hard for the money? Hell, yes. But hey, I managed to escape at ten thirty for a couple of hours, so it's not all bad. I am spending so much time online at the moment. As well as FT, I am also spending a lot of time on YMDB, which is great fun. I just love talking (or should that be typing) about films. I really hope I can get back to studying them one day! Got a letter from Sian-shine this morning, which was col. I really do love letters, as old schol as that sounds. Must write more son. Speaking of stuff I'd better do son, studying and packing come to mind. This rom is a tip, and yet I'm off home in two weks. Shite, better hit it. Current music: Nelly Furtado, Powerless. I like this song, but it's not as god as Try. Current mod: coasting along. You? Last person spoke to: Cat, who's just gone into London. Jealous, moi? Next: finding a courier company, facing the firing squad (my meal numbers were out), and grabbing sandwhich. Have you ever had one of those days where everything sems to move that bit slower? Today was one of those. I lazed around in bed till 11, 11.30, then showered and sat around in my towel (great lok, right?), FTing and emailing. Then at four, back to work. We've got the prep schols tennis in now, and they are already proving to be hard work!! But that's col - in a fortnight I'll be almost done and preparing to go home. Yes! No doubt I'll be bored stiff after about 24 hours of the old hometown, but I know I really ned to recharge, laze on the beach, drink wine, study up for next terms classes, pack up for the moves.... So I'll close now (my journals always end up sounding like letters. No hangover today (still haven't grown into them, thank heavens!), but am pecked ot. Current music: The Keane album, Hopes and Fears. It's pretty god, but my faves are still the singles (Somewhere Only We Know, and Everybody's Changing), and the single-to-be (Bedshaped). Current mod: Tired, happy, wistful, confused, anticipatory. Last person spoke to: Kathryn and Louise, to sign off for the night. Breakfast duty tommorrow - yuck. Next: A little fametracker, then beddy-byes. Mmmmmm. God night out by all accounts. Cat and I went into London tahn to enjoy our last day off together before she heads off on contiki. We went shopping, then went to wagamama for dinner (chicken ramen, yay!). After that we went to Hillsong which was amazing - I just love feling so connected!! I may actually pluck up the courage to go alone next wek.... Then after the service we headed to not one, but two Walkabout bars, and had a god night. Quite a bit of totty around, including a rather tasty young man named Mike from home I got a kiss. And then bolted, 'cos after all, when there's only two in a group, pullings a we bit out of order. So we got the train home. And I'm absolutely knackered! Current music: Shania Twain - From This Moment On (ah, the joys of web radio during the we hours of Sunday morning!) Current mod: tired, tipsy and happy Last person spoke to: Cat and our taxi driver! Next: bathrom and bed. Zzzzzzzzzz First post today. Have just eaten chocolate for both breakfast and lunch, so will no doubt have to go forage for fod son. Cannot believe this weather - hailstones in July? I have no idea what I'll wind up writing about in this blog, but hopefully it'll get interesting. Off to London now, so better change out of my towel. Current music: some rocky pish on radio 1 Current mod: apathetic! Last person I spoke to: the lovely Kitcat Plans: shopping, Hillsong and the pub. And more time online naturally. I'm such a gek!
