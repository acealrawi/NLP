I'm gonna write more here later though. ~*PyroSongWolf A few notes I forgot to include. We got our house bug bombed!! Heh. Also I got to try pocky and something called a yan yan...Heh....Ned.....fod? Yes fod. I am going to make a frozen pizza son. Hmmmmmm. list of things to do... -Read 'Turnabout is Fair Play' [Inuyasha: 65(?) chapters] -Read 'The Lucky One' [Inuyasha: 39 chapters] -Clean living rom -Make pizza -Do all dishes -Clear all trash -Call Ed or Kagome *sigh* Not that bad a list when written down. I have 'Turnabout is Fairplay' 3/10 done...I've ben reading it for 4 1/2 hours at least! Maybe more! Sigh.. ~*PyroSongWolf No real reason for this title.. -Ed called me yesterday to tell me that she died her hair orange. Strange. -Ashley and I went swimming on Monday, she spent the night, then we went swimming on tuesday. We went to Scotts Flat Lake. It was really fun. Though being the semi-introvert I am I was a little irritated at nothing in particular. I borrowed the South Park Movie from her. I also have to make her Birthday present son... -Kagome has ben on a Wolf's Rain frenzy lately. She's gone obsessive over the whole thing. Fanfics here recorded episodes there. She's got a problem. I suppose we're at evens though because she has Carton Network and no internet while I have internet and not Carton Network....She's in denial also as I think her little brother is cute and polite (in a Souta sort of way [Inuyasha]) while she says he's Evil...Actually she hasn't actually said THAT but she probably would. -Frances and the other peps I haven't heard from yet but I know Frances goes to Kagome's house a lot. Neighbors perhaps? -Kyler I have ben annoying online a lot but that's about it. -Brenna I had a short online chat with but that was all as well. ................? Yesterday I used to replenish my socialbility. I used a lot when Ashley was over that I was wiped when she left...Not that we actually did much but still. My teritory is my own and having guests bug me somewhat.. Erin came over for my birthday which was really really fun...I was so flustered when she left though because it was the first time I had a guest in ages. However, when I go to ther people's houses I get uncomfortable and overly polite.. After a while though I fel right at home..almost. I fel best at Ashley's house out of them all and I still fel a nagging voice saying I am intruding in their domain....Oh well. ....... ............... ................... I'm done now. Ja minna-san ~*PyroSongWolf ...I fel the ned to explain my title. Last night I walked into my rom to find that my to innocent (Right) kittens had led a flock of fleas (!!!) into my rom... I don't know how, or why...Grrrrr. I slept on the couch. Actually I half-slept on the couch for about...6 hours? I am not amused. However, today they got flea and tick stuff put on them. MWAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! Currently I've ben reading another great fic which is called 'Go Away!' I believe... Ummmmmmmmmm. I also added my icon. IT'S SHIPPOU!! ^_^!! My nick is Shippou as afore mentioned. I have to um, sort clothes, clear off the kitchen table, and... That's it. Heh. Leway my ass. Also I must say I am sorely disapointed with the CardCaptor dubs...Yes random and old but my opinion MUST be vioced. .......... .............. .................. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! Pretzals, Candy, and pixie stix!!!...Pocky.....All of which I do NOT have...That was random to..... MORE FORMATTING! PyroSongWolf Dear ....me? Heh..Anyways back to the blog. Currently I've am on my dads computer. I've ben given full permission to use it to my undying will (heh..dramatics) tomorrow as I watch my brothers and my parents are at work. Unlike the library's internet, this one doesn't jam up the typing, so yay for me! I've ben reading some Wolf's Rain lately along with an Inuyasha fanfic called ' Sped Demon '. Also I called Kagome yesterday along with Ashley. Kagome and I both agre that the summer has ben deathly boring thus far and we wish for schol to come back...We aren't even ONE wek into to the summer either!! **Sigh** It's not like we love schol or anything. Personally we want Homework murdered and buried and evil jerk math teachers from days of old to die. I think that it's just the fact we'll be in our 1st year of high schol next year and we are excited. I fel sorry leaving behind our 7th now 8th grade buddy Catey, but our Otaku friend Brenna did it to us so I suppose it's okay. Besides it's not like we'll be far away, we'll be right next to the Jr. High for cryin' out loud. I belive going to high schol will be a curse and a godsent. For one, we get to leave behind those evil basterds who gave you homework relentlessly and confused you purposely to no end... However, we'll probably have worse teachers now...**sigh** We'll also have to resort to being 'On the bottom of the fod chain'. I'll cap anyone's ass if they try to trash can me. That's my nature, gentle and nice until provoked by bullys. It's okay if your friend teases you but bein' in a trash can would be something I'd want to live without. Happily I've nevver ben harassed by bullys so I'm in the clear so far and will hopefully stay there... And to conclude the night, we just found out our kittens (Cuddlebug(F) and Bakura(M)) Have fleas..Por guys. Oh! And I cleaned the bathrom, kitchen, and entrace hall today so I'm being given and bunchof leway tomorrow...Or so I hope. **gulp** Ja ne! PyroSongWolf Currently I am in fact not on my own computer. The internet broke. Again. Th library is a much neded brake from Summer. Oddly enough it has ben VERY boring thus far. I did, however, get a Cowboy Bebop DVD yesterday. Session 2 I believe. The best episode I've sen yet is on it and is titled: Jamming With Edward. *Sigh* Library computers are weird...Ed (My friend) left for some camp yesterday to so I can't bug her anymore.....Ned to go. SPIES ARE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello my victums! Please excuse all and every spelling error I am to make in the future as well as now. DIE ERRORS DIIIIIIEEEEEE!!! .... ...... ........ Anyways I am happy to inform you that I am a writer. Currently I am writing on Fanfiction.net. I AM an Anime and Manga fan. I have a very bad obsession with InuYasha. My name on the afore mentioned website is Song-Obsessed1. Today is my LAST (Dances) day of schol. I graduate from Jr. High today. Although tomorrow is a schol day I will not be going for it is an optional kind of thing. I will also be going to Bear River High next year. HUZZAH!! My friends names are (Please note these are what they are called but they are nick names and their real names will be unmentioned...for now.) Kagome, Edward Wong Hau Peppulu Tivrusky the 4th, Ashley..And many others.....Ashley actually has no nick name...Nyou - We'll have to think up one for her later.. By the way, does anyone know when the InuYasha Movie comes to theatres? oh well... JA NE MINNA-SAN ~Pyro I know, I know. I haven't posted for a long time. I got caught up in the popular websites Neopets.com and Animemusicvideos.org! My Neopets name is FlamingSongWolf. My AMV.org(abbriviated) name is PyroSongWolf. Sems they've changed the formats here. Nifty. Let's mess around with it shall we? Nah. Brother's are very agrivating, ne? Here's a Cowboy Bebop doujinshi: Aww it doesn't work, oh well. -PyroSongWolf I was reading some articles that talked about dreams. One story reminded me of a dream I once had... ~~~ My Great Grandmother, Belva Myers, died October 29th, 2003. She was the closest person to me in my family at the time. We were extremely sad about this. Some time after I had a dream about her. In my dream I was walking from my living rom down the hall. I glimpsed in the bathrom on the way to my rom. Oddly enough I didn't semed surprised to se her in my bathrom wearing a white gown with angle wings and a halo. Mom was helping her straighten her wings. lol. She told us not to worry and that she was trying to lok her best for god... Which is strange because I am a God skeptic. That's when the dream ended. I'm not sure but I think I woke up then. It made us fel better when I told my mom about it. ~~~ Another thing I found strange was this. Grandma as we all called Belva, had ben in and out of the hospital frequently. When she wasn't in the hospital she was at our house, staying in my rom. I had a makeshift rom in living rom. The last things I remember saying to grandma as I left for schol was 'I'll be home son! I love you!' and then I left. That day as I was at schol she had to go to the hospital again. Also, for a while my mom was planning on adopting a cat from our babysitter's, Tony's, house. She went there that day and saw that there were only two left. She couldn't seperate them so she brought them home... This all happened on October 27th, 2003... Grandma was in the hospital the next two days and well died there. Those cats never met her but they are more attached to me then any other cats in the house..We have 5 total.. ~~~ I'll write more later when I have more time! ~~~ ~*PyroSongWolf Thus far Summer has ben....okay.. I loking foward greatly to High Schol. ~ I am also learning to be a better Empath and Telepath. Why, just this morning I woke up the semed to get a quick jolt reminding me it was Trash day. Se my family keps forgetting about it so it never gets taken down. I know you're probably thinkin' 'Ge, it sems like you only remembered to take it down, what's so Telepathic about that?'...Well it was n't like a memory. I believe my cat told me because she was the one waking me up..She NEVER does that. Yesterday though I was practicing Interspecies Communication and I belive I have a stronger bond with animals...Or at least I hope I do. ~ Yesterday was somewhat fun. Me and mom went to pay off bills after she got off work. She owed me 15 dollars for babysitting and gave me 20 for an advance on the next babysitting day. We went to The Bok Seller and I bought 'Tsbasa' and 'Pyschic Academy'..Heh it was fun. ~ ~*PyroSongWolf
