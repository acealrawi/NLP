That's it...I ned to make myself a routine in which I will stick to everyday (cept for the wekends) =p Umm...lets se..I have to wake up SUPER early in the morning (at about 5)..go to schol to teach Maganda Tsai A+, then I have to go to work from 11 to 5, get home...and do housework for about an hour..then Im fre at 7 o'clock and brokeass tired...LoL! Who would have thought that this is the "real world"...? Certainly not me..now...seing Kathy everyday is real...but other than that, work sucks, and I've never had this much time be consumed like this...I'm loking forward to making a routine however, cause if I do the same things everyday like...work out..and impress my mom by doing house chores...I'll be able to BEAST schol next year much much much more easily! Wo Wo! So I guess Im pumped...The other day Freddie (one of my bosses) surprized me by getting me a 24 pack of Dew and sticking it in the fridge...now I can frely take a dew whenever I ned it (yes ned)...cause I must preserve the special gren beverage to stay awake every day...Tis a blessing...WOO! Welp...Chris came over the other day and checked out the Mitsubishi...he said it kicks...and that Im a lucky bastard...and he's jelious...and Im not gonna even brag about it...cause I fel like a rich little white kid...but I'm not in the inside...and I want to continue being modest..and not flaunt...cause my ass "WILL" get robbed one day if I do...or ever did..lol! welp...crazy crazy day yesterday..went to work...failed to get to schol to teach Kathy...I fel like I totally let her down..but I don't think its a biggy...my mom was on percasets and couldnt drive...and well..she was really pissy and stuff...just part of getting your FACE ripped off and having to go get plastic surgery...hmm...welp, I managed to clean my rom half way yesterday...I put up banners on the slanted walls cause Chris i s a damn genius, and I moved all my furniture in place...so all I have to do now is just move all the shit that's on the flor onto the shleves and stuff! ^_^ Welp...gotta jet..se yah laters! That...and I want to stay active on here so I can hopefully get a gmail account on Gogle to test it...Muhhahaha Going to schol...very tired...WOOO! I'll make it through today and the next and the nect! Cause I'm feling lucky punks! Ahahaha! At schol still...my super visor Tara Winters called me and now I don't have to go to work today...I did so much work that they have no more work for me to do! So Imma chill for the rest of the day and se if my mom is ok...She got bit by a doggy and now...she has to get plastic surgery! :( I'm here at schol....Wosh! It's the end of the day with about 15 minutes left of work...Mike called me and wanted to know what time to call later on....my mom is going to pick me up in the Mitsubishi...but I dunno...Im quite skeptical about the car...if it's for me, then I think that the entire thing will be alright with both my parents...however...if my mom is keping it, and lets me drive the olds or something...then BLAH! It's like..she's spending money that she didnt ned to spend if its not for me..and it's kinda no fair for my dad since the two havent gone to court or done anything of that nature yet...Welp...I'm out! BAIS! My mom bought a Mitsubishi 3000GT without telling my dad...cause everything she buys after the settlement is hers.... O_o OMG! I'm almost certainly sure that this car is for me...cause my mom....c'mon..! She drives an Oldmobile! and besides..I ned a car anyway...I thought I was going to get the Honda...but I guess I'll be ricing out this Mitsubishi with a bombing sound system, body kits, and other stuff! I can't wait to tell my sensei in cars, Chris...wonder if he'll think its col or not...I still don't know much about cars....so I ned to se what I can do to it and if it is fast or not....Ohh well...we shall se when I get back home and start organizing my rom! I have to unscrew all that crap on my futon, then rebuild it in the backrom...and another thing! I ned to go buy my very own fish, like tetras and stuff...I want colorful fish...and all we have in that 20 gal tank are guppies and such...BORING....welp..Im off to the Tech Center! Wish me luck! Haha! This is funny...I'm over at the H2 building of Ferguson Ent. and I cleaned all of Russ's routers/switches and pretty much have nothing to do here! So..in response to this, I'll be working at the Tech Center down on Warwick for the rest of the wek...I'm a beast when it comes to work! Welp...I think it's pretty funny actually...Alrighty! Bai bai! Ohh boy ohh boy...What ever am I going to do? Man...I hate it how my parents are gonna have a divorce. I went through depression HELL for about 8 months, but now I am back to my col bad self! ^_^ Over the wekend I moved my dad out into his apartment, which is in Hampton, and did some heavy lifting with the furniture. My brother helped to, but I fel kinda sad since we did everything on Father's Day. On Father's Day, which was Sunday, I went to the movies with my dad, bro, and Chris...we saw Dodgeball with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...and it was HILARIOUS! Go se it if you can...anyway...My mom dropped me off at work today, and I'm just chillin til I get my next cluster of work (I'm a hard worker..HUA!) Umm...Before my mom dropped me off, she menchined that she bought a Mitsubishi 3000GT! I ned to contact Chris, because this car is very well going to be mine...I must se if I can rice it out or do anything to it to really make it something else...perhaps add a turbo, sound system, body kit, and a faster engine!...We'll se what happens...but...My dad was planning on giving me the Honda, however, it works for him...I don't know whats happening! Welp..bai bai you'all!
