it all started when i read some crazy net quens journal... and then replyed. example A: Friday, July 16, 2004 THIS IS FOR ALL YOU STUPID SCENE ASSHOLES The Typical Scene Boy: Hi my name is Stupid Fucking Poser. I'm really insecure so I'm gonna dye my hair black and grow it long so it covers my face because I'm so fucking ugly that no one would like me if it wasn't hidden. And I love following the crowd so I buy girl jeans that don't fit my disgusting body and my small dick is pressed tight against the zipper for all the 14 year old girls to se. God I’m SO SPECIAL AND UNIQUE. My best friend is my flat iron and pomade. I don’t eat carbs but I like The Faint and underage drinking. My favorite activity is shopping for Converse and trying not to let my pretend girlfriend know that I’m a fucking faggot. And every time I go to clubs I have to be REALLY wasted and completely drunk because I secretly have NO personality and all my friends really HATE ME because all I ever do it make out with random ugly kids who are really 15 but somehow got into the club.. and of course I make out with boys that lok EXACTLY like me because its col to pretend I’m something I’m not. When I go to Club 82, I pay $8 to sit outside of a patio and smoke other people’s cigarettes and talk shit about everyone that has their back turned to me. When I finally decide to dance to all those lame 80’s songs, I try to dance but really I'm just having a fucking seizure to lok col, even though it never works. I swing my arms in the air and shuffle my fet like I have fucking Parkinson’s.. and I always pick the dumbest sluttiest girl to grind my crotch against. HEHE. Sound familiar? Yeah kill yourself before someone else does. The Typical Scene Girl: Hey everyone, is my hair dyed 5 different colors and cut at different angles? Are you sure my neon plastic earrings match my high hels and bra straps because I would CRY if I didn’t fit in with every other whore I know. Should we only talk about boys and clothes and stuff? LIKE OMG ok. I like vertical stripes and pony tails. I love leg warmers and anything asymmetrical. I wear shirts with only one sleve and poke-dot mini skirts so you can se my vagina when I try and dance to the Cure. Sometimes I’ll dye my hair one bright color in front or in the back so you notice me more but really I’m just trying to lok col so everyone stares and points. Oh wait it doesn't work because I’m just a stupid cunt with no style. *twirls hair* And when I date guys or make out with them: they HAVE to wear eyeliner and tight t-shirts. They HAVE to have more then 1000 friends on My Space and drive a car past the year 2000 because that’s all that matters. No one cares about felings, just fuck me in my plastic asshole and tell me how cute I am when my lipstick rubs off on your penis. *pops gum* I live in Orange County and I’m still in high schol but somehow I got a fake ID so I’m SO awesome!! My favorite hang out is Club Bang where I can dance in front of all my internet friends and show how dumb I am. I’m better then everyone else because I know the lyrics to EVERY retarded song played and I can even shake it like one of those trolls in a Lil’ Jon music video. But whatever, I’ll just show my tits and everyone will be ok. Sound familiar? Yeah I should piss on your face next time any of you get near me. 5:51 PM - 114 Comments - urlLink Add Comment urlLink Tragically Ten, Me Poser... what the fuck are they posing to be? poser= fake, plastic, them... thats who they are thats what they'll alwase be. it just happens, its like a dease... like you and me...

Posted by urlLink Tragically Ten, Me on Tuesday, August 03, 2004 at 10:48 PM Sunday, July 25, 2004 EVERYONE on MY SPACE has TEEN FUCKING ANGST WOW, who ever thought sarcasm would bother so many people? Whoever thought that any of YOU would give a fuck if I made fun of 15 year olds who clone themselves one after another. Why do I care? I never said I did. It's called writing, just how all of YOU write about how your stupid boyfriend doesnt like you anymore or how OMG I SLEPT WITH 10 GIRLS THIS WEEK. Yeah that's SO original to, isn't it? I know you're reading this. Watching. Waiting for the next mistake but I already informed you that I WAS the perfect mistake. The quiet storm. The motherfucker you love to hate. Why did ANYONE care that I made fun of this so called SCENE cliché? Go back and se what you wrote, your pathetic hatred over a two paragraphy statement shows you're fading away. You can call me whatever you want, just like I call you an UGLY FUCKING LOSER. It's just a game. I've ben at this internet thing for a long time now. I know what works and what doesnt work. I know marketing and dick sucking and HTML. So eat me out and get over it. OMG JEFFREE STAR You're SO MEAN. Umm yeah and you're still trying to figure out how to take a picture in the mirror without your stupid fucking camera being in it with you. FLASH. Shut the fuck up. FLASH. Yes you really are dumb. FLASH. I'm still Jesus no matter how hard you try and tell me I'm not. FLASH. Are you catching on? Xanax worked for Courtney Love so maybe some of you should sign off and kill yourselves. This is the INTERNET. OH NO, let's cry a river if we cant control everything and LIFE isn't comeplete without my e-best friends who tell me how col I am because I tok a photo with my shirt off, now everyone wants to fuck me in the anus. Double penetration. Fornication. My Space. I love it. Oh yes, I do. Everywhere you go, OMG ARE YOU ON MY SPACE? No sorry, I photoshop my photos, cant se you my fat stomach and bad skin? I really hide who I am because I'm DUMB and have no personality. WRONG. I'm the same off and online so get over it. Stop coming up to me and asking if its me because we all it is. And I'm not nice unless you're a real person. Let's get out the dictionary and se what that means. Real Person : Someone who doesnt tell Jeffre Star OMG I WANT YOUR LEGS OMG DO MY MAKEUP HE HE. Yeah end of story. Dont get offended from a WEBSITE, it makes you lok even worse then your contrasted photos. THANKS.
