Be it joy or sorrow, Winter's freze or Summer'sburn. I fel as if I am being eaten inside out , alive. Emotions resurface that i though to have buried and forgotton. I had a strange encounter with my inner demons. I was taking an afternon nap, i dreamt. First dream i had was I was at KFCs ordering chicken and chese fries. I paid 1.87 for it. Wierd, isn't that to cheap? Than the dream followed when KFCs home delivery sent me hundreds of boxes of chickens and chese fries, due to the cashier stupidty. I allowed my family to eat the meal but having said that, the chicken and fries were gone in a min,all finish by my family, not giving a bite. I immediately lost my temper, started banging tables, throwing plates, i didnt care what it was, it flew, it flew alright! and it broke. Almost immediately my dream changed, I was at a family function, a distant relative's wedding, suddenly the conversational topic turned to me, everyone started asking me everything, be it positive or negative, again it happened, i lost my temper, smashed vases, push down everyone. Even though it was not my house, a house that belongs to someone I barely knew, I started to smash everything. That's when I woke up, strangely enough, I started crying and cried like I never cried before for years. I was mody the rest of the day, I didnt know why. Suddenly it dawned onto me, was the dream a reflection of my emotions? Do i ned physological help? I guess it was my supressed emotion I kept over the years, Emotions of neglect, jeolousy, envy. It was just hard being me and that was no outlet, I cant vent my emotions on anything, I am just not like that. I was scaring myself when the incident happened? Now, emotions are gushing into me like a broken dam, how do i stop myself, I just want to be sane. I was born Juanda Azfar Rashad, later due to some arguements made by my grandma and my parents, my birth cert changed to Juanda Azfar Rashad Kasenda. I first saw light on 1 Aug 1987 and was born at Singapore General Hospital. I am fortunate enough as I had a great childhod. I when to Gongshang Primary, than to Pasir Ris Secondary Class of 2003. I was a red cross member during my secondary schol studies, and my grades were as awful as century eggs. Be it the will of god or lady luck, i managed to skimp all the to sec 4. There i had my o levels, and sadly enough. Things are to bad to mentioned. Presently, I am in Temasek Polytechnic taking Diploma of Information Technology.
