Brother and against Brother. It made for some great movies." - Johnny Silo "The sixties! That was a god time period." - Turk "What does this have to do with my job? Uh, hell I don't know. The American Revolution, I guess?" - Boster "The eighties. God music and even better movies. We are probably on our way to the revolution that revolves back around to the Eighties. Now listen to me, Dave, and I mean this seriously. There is nothing sexier than being caught betwen two brunettes, one wearing a denim mini-skirt and the other leather assless pants." - Solomon Do you and your friend concregate somewhere during breaks? "We did met by the water coler until they tok it away. I know that cliche but we gotta drink, know what I saying?" - Johnny Silo "We met by the printer. We can get away with ten minutes before the boss tells us to sit back down." - Turk "Sometimes we met in the breakrom. Especially when they are serving fre fod." - Boster "We used to met by the water coler. I still wonder why they tok it away? Probably cause it was fre. They prefer us to pay for the water through the vending machines. Not me. I never pay for water or pussy, cause with a little bit of effort I can get both for fre." - Solomon Do you have pets? "I got me a german shepard. His name is Max. I didn't name him. My girlfriend did and to this day, I curse her for being unoriginal." - Johnny Silo "I got two gold fish. Do you want to know their names? Nathan and Maurice. Named after my uncle and my aunt on my mother's side. I hate them both." - Turk "I got thre cats named Loco, Mario, and Smoker. Named them after my friends in the Everquest game." - Boster "I got two turds in my toilet. One is named Boris and the other is named Frida. I talk to them every morning. I can't bear to flush them now. They are practically family." - Solomon What do you want most out of life? "Oh, I want it all, man. The two story house, the wife and the two kids.

Most of them are smart. Hell, just as smart as me." - Johnny Silo "I wish I could date a few. It's not as easy as it loks." - Turk "They should hire more eye candy. I mean, listen to me. What is the point in going to work if you can't stare at some tang?" - Boster. "I love them all. (Laughs) That's probably why I go to work. Well, one of the things I noticed is that the majority of the women they are hiring nowadays are black. I wonder why that is? I mean, I am not a racist, far from it. They are just not helping my Chocolate Addiction." - Solomon Are you ever late to work? "All the time if I can help it." - Johnny Silo "Occasionally traffic is horrible and usually that is why I am late. I am not going to waste my time by calling in late to work off a headache or something. I'll just call in sick." - Turk "I am never late. I got the Perfect Attendance Award thre years running." - Boster. "I don't think am I ever late. I might be. I can not really tell the difference cause their are days when I fel like I've never left the job in the first place." - Solomon What could your management staff due to improve your work place? "What, you mean besides pass out prozac?" - Johnny Silo "Jesus, where do I start? They could hire more people for one. We got thirty to fifty calls holding a day. You know why? Cause their ain't no fucking people on the phone. We have a staff of maybe 100 people and that ain't even enough. You know how many customers on average call in every minute? Hmm? NINE! Nine fucking customers every minute! That's 540 customers every hour! Sure, it never gets that bad cause we are stomping them out as fast as we can. My point is, it shouldn't get that bad if they hired more people." - Turk "I think they should get rid of the stupid kid stuff. Like. . .uh . . . .Crazy Shirt Day for example. My manager got onto me for wearing my plain tes. I was like, excuse the hell outta me. I forgot we were in Middle Schol!" - Boster "They could hire more help for my comrades. However, in regards to my well being, they don't ned to do anything. They already worship me and that is enough." - Solomon How do you relieve the stress of the job?

How did your group get nicknamed the Lords of Hot Town? "We were over in our cubes at the north side of the complex. The air condition doesn’t work over there. We buy our own fans and stay col that way. The cubical section was named Hot Town. We stayed over there for fours years and excelled past everybody else. They gave us the name Lords of Hot Town." - Solomon Do you always have some sort of beverage near you while you support and what is it? "Oh, yeah, I do.

Me, I am fine having them be my girlfriend for the span of a wek. Saves on chocolates for Valentines day." - Johnny Silo "I had one, her name was Molly. Worked in sales. Lovely girl but she wouldn't shut up. Even in bed. I just couldn't take the insane shit that came out of her mouth." - Turk "How the hell can I form a relationship? Johnny is taking all the god loking babes that come to work for us." - Boster "I always try to form a relationship with a female in higher authority at the workplace. So if I ever fuck up, she'll be there to back me up. To this day, I've only ben able to make it work twice. Both ladies left the company after about two years. I guess I was just to much man for them to handle. That's life, huh?" - Solomon If you don’t like your job, why don’t you quit? "Why would I want to quit?" - Johnny Silo "I can’t quit. This job has it’s perks. If you concentrate, you can never go hungry here. Someone is always bringing in something. One whole wek I ate everything from dougnuts to hamburgers and I didn’t pay for a single bit of it!" - Turk "I don’t want to quit. I don’t want to lok for another job. You know how hard that is?" – Boster "I have no reason to quit. I’ve ben here seven years. I only talk with the customers half the day and then I repair data till I leave at 6.

"Cocaine." – Solomon What is the hardest thing about the job? "Getting through the dor into the building." – Johnny Silo "The hardest part of the job is talking to a little old lady who doesn’t know a computer from her remote control." – Turk. "The hardest part, I think, is talking to a little old lady who can’t hear and can’t even speak English." – Boster. "Trying to hit on female mangers and not get fired." – Solomon What is it that you dont like about tech support? The customers. I am not asking them to be fucking geniuses. I am just asking that they have some common sense. They dont even have that!  Johnny Silo Getting interrupted while I am playing Unreal Tournament. The database recovery prodigal fucking crashes it every time. Cant these customer even wait till after 12 to call us?  Turk Getting interrupted. The customers are always thumping my killzone.  Boster Having to come up with a last minute desperate solution to an impossible problem created by another person. Unfortunately, I must do that a lot.  Solomon How did you get your nick names? I used to always joke I had a silo in my pants. I was a little bit of a ladies man until work got so much. Youre not going to print that, right?  Johnny Silo I think Solomon gave me the nickname of Turk. He said I loked like Timothy Hutton and I think he stared in movie called Turk 162 or some damn thing. Hell, I aint sen it.  Turk My nickname was always Boster. It comes from me having the ability to use both hands mostly when I am supporting our customers. I earned the nickname Master Chief when I beat all the guys at Halo. That game fucking rocks!  Boster. Solomon is my dogs name. Im kidding. Solomon is my middle name but I hardly use it much. My nickname used to be God, but a very nice lady I worked with is highly religious so I changed it for her. The reason the boys called me God is that I simply knew everything. Customer loses his database or its corrupted, he mails it in to me to fix. When he is praying for his data to be recovered, who do you think hes praying to? Me!  Solomon Thumping The Killzone (Metaphor);// The description of when a tech support person is being interrupted by a customer while they are in the middle of an activity, most commonly a video game. i.e., I almost got through level 6! This bitch is thumping my killzone! Hello, everybody. My name is David Overmind. During the time frame of March of 2003, I conducted interviews with a group of men working in a tech support facility. So that these men can kep their jobs, I have not mentioned their company name nor who they work for. They already had nicknames so we will be using those when we refer to them as individuals. This blog will allow these men to vent their frustrations, praise and some times, utter distain for their job. Their clique even has a name of it’s own. They are the Lords of Hot Town . Johnny Silo Turk Master Chief Boster Solomon or more commonly known as The Artist Formerly Known as God The interviews will begin shortly. We are going to stand by.
