shit.....i told them not to get my hopes up...cuz i knew not to...ive learned that people like me should NOT get to thinking that something could acttually go right for once....when will it be my turn to be happy?...i think i deseve one fucking happy day? havent i ben through fucking enough? fuck!!!! i fel like everyone in the fucking world is forgeting about me....i found out an hour ago that gober well...is with one of my friends.....nice touch...yea...that was a god old slap in the face...what for?...for actually thinkin i had a chance...yea...im fucking retarded....christ!! i shouldve just kept to myself like i usually do with that shit...i should just go back with tom....cuz i mean...like atleast i know that no matter how many times i leave him i can allways go back...and trust me me and him have had our god times...but them our bad....like the time he fucking shoved me down a set of fucking stairs cuz i didnt fel like fucking him considering our last time we were together...we were foling around and his phone rings and he hangs up and tells me i gotta go cuz his girl friend was gonna be there son....that sucked....but ill get to se him son...and weve ben talking alot about us...and i do miss him...i do want him back.....but i dunno if im over someo one...im not but thats not gonna happen again....im just so....empty....im thinking about tom though...cuz i do really miss him...i miss being with him...i miss his hugs and his kisses...and weird enough i even miss fighting with him.....but more than i miss him i miss someone else....someone whos more than likely moved on...and that sucks...so i guess i should just move on to....go back to tom...even though i dont know if thats the best idea....cuz well...things happen when im with him god and bad...oh fuck....i do miss him an awful lot....ive decided that im through with my old friends and moving on to the new...cuz all the old ones do is bring me down when i ned to be brought up...while the new can do that...they actually care...its sad acttually...but oh well....on sat. im going to party with the new...and i just thought of something great....i should have one of them go to valley fair...the old would hate it if i brought one of them with....muhahah...yea...well...im fucking fucked up to continue this blog...ill finish it later tonight.... ~brittany well...another fucking wekend has gone by

was god...saw king arthur...the one i wanted to go to so bad....but it sucked cuz janet(bitch!) was with and her and darrin made out the whole fuckin time...and then trent was depressed about nikki so he went and sat alone so i sat alone to...that sucked....ya know im getting sad again...i dont know why either...so much for the therapy huh?...waste of fucking time that was!...ha....oh well....ill just kill myself eventually...ha...great view of life huh?...oh yea....speaking of life the art thing went well...ill start next year...yea....if i get that far....i wish i could get over some of my fears about life and people...i ned to trust people....but i dont and that causes all my relationships to crash and burn.....damn it why do i have to be so fucked up? i just...oh i dunno...my life is going by way to fast...but i fel like im sittin here watching it crumble but by time i notice something happening its over...and then i lost again....im so fucking sick of the people in my life....sick of my god damn whiny family and friends who drive me nuts...and then theres two other people who kep fucking with me...the one fucks with my felings while the other fucks with my head...i just feling like giving up on this shit...fuck guys all that happens is i shut down with them...and then it just goes down hill from there...and im sick of it...but then theres the ever so confusing thoughts on my head....only a couple people know bout that....and only those people ned to know....oh my...the fine emotional train wrecks i get in to....what a fucking mess...you can allways tell when im gettin worse...like emotionally nonstable again cuz my swearing rate goes way up....but who the fuck cares not me...but then i care about things to much....things that shouldnt bother me...but i let them bother me...and its fucking retarded...i had to baby sit that little shit this wekend...jesus christ he fucking drives me up the god damn wall!!!!...i couldve fucking killed the shit last night....my mom said i could have a little bon fire thingy...thats col cuz then my plan will work....that is if the people that i ned to be there show up...but knowing me no one will show up.....oh fucking well!..ill get over it eventually.....anyways....im sick of righting....so yea..im gonna go then... ~brittany well....i have ALOT to write...so here i go..... me and brett were just not god together....sure we had our fun...that means abit of makeing out....but it just wasnt working. the break up mainly was because of the fourth of july...he chose to ignore me and be an ass hole...so i got pissed...but we stayed together after that for a wek...then i broke up with him on the 9th....well after we broke up we got into a fight about sex...i wanted it he didnt cuz hes a god little catholic boy...but i even told him i could wait but no he had to make me horrible for even bringing it up...that was a BIG mistake....i never realized how much of an asshole he could be...but that same night me and dalton made plans to hok up at trents party on sat. well...now the subject of trents party...oh my...this is a biggie...well....i guess it was pretty fun the god and the bad....well ill start at the begining...dalton came and picked me up...we went to trents....travis, luke n, luke g, chris, dalton, trent and me we the only ones who stayed the night....yes i was the only girl!...well...that was an intersting night...we were just sitting around the fire and then out of the blue luke n. says as calm as can be "brittany, can i se your bobs?" it shocked the living hell out of me...and it made my stomic flip..because ive had the biggist crush on luke for the last 3 years....anyways...well..i tok off my shirt and they all tok off theirs..it was a god night...hehe....but then they tryed to stuff me into the coler and thought that was funny...but then chris and luke decide to go streak to the end of trents driveway.....i wish i would have loked at lukes cute little ass.....hehe....well it started pouring out so we went into the garage...except luke he was tired...well it was 5-6 in the morning....anyways chris decides we should play truth and dare...that was gay...well he decides that for my final dare i had to let someone lick my nipple...that was wrong...but i picked trent cuz he was the most gay so it wouldnt matter if he did...and he did..then we stripped down and went swimming..that was fun...i was so cold though..i thought my bobs were going to fall off...we finally fell asslep about 7 30...i was so tired...oh me and dalton never hoked up...thank god!!!..but then i decied that i was gonna tell luke how i felt about him over an IM...that went well...i think...everyone is telling me to go for him but..no...i would kill to be with luke..but i just broke up with brett....and now what i still have a few things to write....well..ill go to brett....well....i had gotten a HUGE feling of regret for breaking up with him...and well...i talked to him about it...and well that didnt go well....i got the whole friends thing....that sucked....but then...yea ill admit that much of yea i wish i would have kept my mouth shut...but god damn..ill get over it....oh then theres corey....well...i once went out with him in the same situation im in now...actually the same reason i almost might now...for example...i had just broken up with brett...same as now....i still wanted to be with brett...same as now....i was confused...same as now....and i felt guilty...same as now...so im just hopeing corey wont ask me out cuz it will be to hard to say no.....i cant say no to people..i fel to bad....but then there are people telling me to just go for luke...oh i would if i had the courage...and if i didnt like him so much...but im just to scared that hell say no....oh the biggest news i got....this guy from this art schol from the cities is gonna come here tomarrow and lok at my paintings to se if im god enough for the schol...how fucking great is that?...well...thats about it...i guess....hmm....wish me luck!!! ~brittany
