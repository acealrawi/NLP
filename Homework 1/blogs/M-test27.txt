And if you told me to jump off a cliff, I'd say okay. Ive done it now, and now I'm not biased to it now. well, I'm in Knoxville now and its great, we got here the day before yesterday, and its ben great, we walked around town night before last and then we went to this uber col bokstore last night, tonight I dont know what we're doing, but I strongly believe that Adam can increase the "fun factor" of the night, he's ben able to each night. well, Ive got to go now, Ill be posting more often now. talk to you later AND again I say no! Jack Black as My FAVORITE SUPERHERO!? (The gren Lantern, which the movie is still in development is to put Jack Black on as The Gren Lanturn.) no no no. Dont get me wrong but this is what has ben said about the film: "The gossip site( urlLink aint it col news ) says that the film adaptation (of The Gren Lantern) is being described as a "crazy and zany film" and will be in the realm of Jim Carrey's "The Mask." The site also says that DC Comics is objecting to this approach but that Warner Bros. has the final say. " This just dissapoints me, The Gren LAnturn has always ben my fave superhero, and Now Warner Bros. is going to degreade his persona, oh how the mighty have ben tripped and have fallen... Well, I just thought I put some emphasis on the fact that I am a Catalyst thinker. But what Is a Catalyst thinker? It is somone whom Adam thinks is worthy to be linked to on his site, well, I am linked, so thats that. you can get to Adams Site urlLink here urlLink Well I'm here at the church office and I' am listening to this really fricken awesome band called Falling Up. they're col, you should listen to them, yeah. well Adam says we're fixin to go, I wrote some songs finally, and I'm ready to go now to where'er we go, which I belive at the moment the location of interest is Amandas house. http://www.fallingupcrashings.com/ Well guys sorry I havent posted in a while... Ive had a Busy wek. Well, I went to an appointment with my mom yesterday, it was okay, but todays wasn't, I wish I could have ben there. I went to Charlies house last night, it was AWESOME!! we had about, 5 guitars goin at the same time, it was great, all there, praisin God, yea, but I forgot my guitar, so halfway thru I went and talked to Amanda, and then that was about the basis of my night. Went to the mall today, got some "Love Spell" put on me and saw some girl pick her wedige, that was repulsive, what HAS the world come to, when girls have the fortitude to pull up their skirts and pick wedgies? I dont know. Well, I'll post more later, mom neds the computer. if you only knew... if you only knew... well today was an interesting day, I just got through with some "business" that I had to attend to, which I wont elucidate in here, for there are prying eyes about... well, spent the night at Adams house, and then went to Matts house adn then went home, well, Im glad Im home ( for some odd reason) , Im tired, I have HAMS and I wanna make some music, but Im frusterated so Ill son make music b4 I slep and then Probably watch a movie, and then probably talk on the net, and probably, go to slep then... we'll se how that turns out wont we!? otay then i dont know what to write anymore Okay then, whats all this? I'm gonna go play my guitar for the rest of the night tonight, and eventually fall aslep as I normally do when I ned to think deply. maybe I really ned to breathe deply, take a break, but I cant. Umm, the word "umm" just epitomizes that which I am feling right now... I'll explain in the morning im to tired and blank minded to know right now...ive got church in the morning. well, i woke up this morning to my father "Wake up and come help me clean the yard, I'm gonna mow the yard." so I moaned,and got up to help thinking, okay, I'll be up for about twenty mins, and then I can go back to bed, ill thought on my behalf I guess... Im awake now and I have nothing to do, and im still tired, but I can't get back to slep, im up now, what do ya want!? okay, well, i wanna do something today, so when mom gets back from Home depot, (shes ben there for about 2 hours now, I wonder what shes doing!?) I'll se if we can go to the mall, and Amanda was saying she was gonna be bored today, so I'll se if she wants to come, better check her journal, and se if shes ben online yet... and then I'll have to get off-line to call her... I'll post more later! g'day mates! okay it hasn't ben a while since my last post, but I was thinkin, I miss being called Mose, I really do... I miss it... okay, tok a shower tryin to go to bed.... dont you just hate the feling that your screaming, but you dont know what you're screaming about?... i dont kno... WHY DONT WE FREAKEN MOVE TO LAKELAND!? sorry about that recent outburst, just a little thing. umm, well, I wish we would move, I've got the best friends ever here, (no offence to the Fort Meadeans who accept me, though you are so few in number) and people accept me. and I'd just really like it. either move or the stupid state law changes and lets me drive alone now... that'd be great, I'm not a bad driver.... maybe i Should do that now anyways, break the law, its not like i havent done it in the past. but o well... well i had much much more to write, but i gotta write an email now to, so Ill talk to all the few people that read this blog later, Godnight well i dont know of much interesting that has happened lately, i got some Tart N' Tinys, which is like bliss in a tiny, tart, tart n tiny, and i wish i was listening to some Nirvana right now, and ... and ... and... umm crap i lost my train of thought, i really wish i had a cabose, i wonder what others think about that... Orazael: i ned a cabose XoGRITSxo: hey, i'm sorry, lol, but i was just leaving Orazael: i ned a cabose RKrox3: huh? Orazael: i ned a cabose AaRainbow05: lol Orazael: i ned a cabose gato89kc: a cabose?? gato89kc: why? gato89kc: lol well there it is, what happens when you tell ppl you ned a cabose, by the way, my SN on AIM is Orazael thats all for now i guess.... what has the world come to, its 12:36 AM right now and i was rotin about in an AIM chattrom being boring and found a 6th grade girl(wasnt lokin for one, but i found one), just talkin away to me (odd i thought, and still do, its past her bed-time im sure), i loked on her "live journal" and found that one of her posts was full of explaitive after explaitve sent to some strange por sap named "Tyler" i wasnt as much a potty mouth as her when i was in 6th grade,sure i said a few bad words here and there, but i could taste the soap when i was done. im flabberghasted. wow. well, i guess thats it for my first post! you could say its a grand opening of sorts... o well Charley has now passed over my house, and left some damage, se the second picture (it was our barn), but other than that, no human injuries. and, well Im still hoping to et to lakeland somehow tomorrow, I sure hope they have more power than I do, we have none, but the phone lines still work, so I can sue the laptop battery, as I am doing now. well id better scot, battery will die son, and im about to go into slep mode.- Godnight I hope all my fellow Floridians are well... And that is my favorite picture of him. I got to get picked up and go to his house tonight, before whence setting out unto the Wed. night service for fun. I got covered in shaving cream, popcorn and corn chips placed on me, and then I couldn't se, but Mandy, whom I met tonight gave me the gift of sight by wiping off one side of my "goggles" thus I was able to se. we sang then and, and heard Adam speak, which was another highlight, and then Marlon tok me home. We will sit upon getting gason the way home for a moment. We were at the "PIX" Gas Station. there is a girl there that I met when we were having the "Scavenger Hunt" one Wed. night and I met her with Jonathan. Jon knew her, and we neded an Attendant to wipe our windshield for one of the "hits" that we had to film, she was that attendant. but It was funny tonight being that she obviously didnt remember who I was, but knew that I loked familiar and I was watching her try to figure out where she had sen me before. It was actually quite intriguing. but again, i must say, before i go to bed. Marlon Wareley is my FAVORITE South African. My first days of have ben col I guess, I have a god schedule, and Im sure I can get straight A's and have a god year this year, I have no last period class so I get outta schol at 12:45 practically every day, which includes my lunch. which is col, and I can graduate with 25 credits to. but you know whats funny, its already ben two days, and Ive already found a girl on my radar that I admire, I hate that, I dont want to like people just yet I'm to quixotic, and it'll only be a matter of time before she hurts me ha ha. oh well, I'll control myself. Off of that subject now thanks, Ive got some col teachers, and a few col friends, I'm trying to stray away from the crowd that I was in last year, yet they are the only place I fit in, I trust God to help me. Which I am col with doing. And it shouldnt be hard to do. on the 23rd I start college, and second semester I am a Seinor, wich I am technically now, but literally I wont be until next semeseter. So thats that. Goin to Adam's tomorrow. should be god, Ill post again from there. Godnight. Or at least the muffin man, I had to bake muffins last night for this teacher breakfast thingy at schol, and I'm not gonna go on a rant about "Schol" because it scares me, even the thoughts of such. So I baked muffins last night, talked to Jon on the phone, and then recorded some "musac" until my eyelids obscured my vision. Ergo I was then Aslep. Thus, I woke up this morning fatigued and quite in ned of a god espresso, alas I did not have this and I am now running on empty at this point and time. But I will wrok thru it. Ill post more in a few mins when I can find something interesting to post about! Well I couldnt think of much to post on tonight and I knew that I neded to stay consistent in my posts. so I know that which I am going to post about tonight. Saturday night was the greatest. We had our first "youth whom are going into the ministry" small group meting thing. it was bliss for me, I really neded something like that. We got to learn alot that night and share alot to (yes I did still mange to stick my fott in my mouth as always a few times). Today, was a fairly decent day, Matt kept me up til 3 the morning before church by playing music. as he always does before going off to bed, the only thing was was that I had my guitar out, so I'd hear a song and be like "I love that song, Ihave to learn it" so I would, so now I know 311 "Love Song" which is an awesome song to say the very least and I also know "Float On" by Modest Mouse. I learned more, but alas I am tired tongiht and I have since forgotten the songs, and Matt tok the CD that I learned the songs from home. oh well! okaeday then. well we get to church and church stressed me out. i ned to get ore slep before church later on, i know this now. but it was awesome! there were quite a few people from Anna Maria Island down and it was great getting to se all them again, I even got to know that Ben and I are alot alike. Then, we went to a cokout thingy and it was god, I got to met some new people, in particular, Kendra (i do hope that is the correct spelling) a friend of Amandas, she was quite col. After the cokout thingy Adam, Matt, Lora and I returned to Adams house. Then, everyone but me went out to eat. and I did some latin and got to eventually talk to my BEST FRIEND Amanda which I enjoyed muchly. But just for a moment, let me deviate off to some "ranting" about my friend. I love my best friend (in a totally "friend manifesto" not a "more than friend manifesto") and she is in my opinion one of my my favorite people. we had a few moments today, but the most intriguing was when something was said about "a mission trip to go fishing" and she and I both, at the same time said "we would be fishers of.......fish!!" which was quite interesting. we have the whole "mental connection thing" goin on and we tend to sya the same things at thte same time, or finish each others sentences, which is col. I would have a Best Friend no other way. In the great words of Lassie "WOOF! WOOF!"
